### Hi there 👋

Hello there! 🌟 Thanks for stopping by. Dive in to explore my journey and the expertise I bring to the table.

About Me 🙋‍♂️
Currently, I'm embarking on an exhilarating journey as a full-time Master's student at the renowned University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, specializing in Advanced Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence. My experience isn't just academic; with 2 years under my belt as a Product Engineer, I've been at the forefront of creating tools that power dynamic ecosystems.

Projects I'm Passionate About 🚀
instruct2action: Pioneering a new automation paradigm with the power of AI.
CRDT-based Collaborative Song Database: A unique blend of distributed systems and music.
Embracing Versatility 🌐
Tech is vast, and I believe in exploring its expanse. I'm not one to be pigeonholed into a single tech stack. As a generalist, I dive deep into various technologies, ensuring I'm always on the cutting edge and keeping my creativity at its peak.

Where AI Meets CI/CD 🤖⚙️
With a robust foundation in AI, I've ventured into the world of CI/CD, working with substantial language models like Bloom and Flan. This blend of AI and CI/CD is where I shine, bringing innovation to traditional pipelines.

Containerization Aficionado 📦🚀
The world of containerization is my sandbox. From Docker to Kubernetes, I've orchestrated, optimized, and even built tools to make these containers dance to my tunes.

Solving the Unsolvable 💡🔍
One of my proudest moments was demystifying the Language Server Protocol. Through meticulous research and hands-on experimentation, I transformed complex documentation into a tangible project, complete with a guide to help others navigate this niche technology.

A Fusion of Skills 🔗🚀
While each of my skills is potent on its own, together they form a symphony of expertise that's rare and valuable. From CI/CD and containerization to software development and AI, I'm always pushing the envelope, eager to learn and grow.
